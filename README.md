### Learning Rust
#### And Other Curiosities About the World

This collection of programs and ramblings is meant to be a central place for
applying concepts for learning Rust, or rather, for relearning what I once
knew and better applying myself to the processes.

The directory `./rbe-examples` is a collection of each of the corresponding
example applications built from the wonderful book, Rust By Example which I
highly recommend and which you can find [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example).

The exercise of studying, applying, and taking note of the conceptes laid out
in the Rust by example book were exceptionally helpful in providing insight to
the way in which the language was designed.

Moving forward in the process of learning Rust more thoroughly, I've created a
directory to house a similar project for the "Rust Book" which is a more example
based approach. You can find the most recent version of the Rust Book 
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/foreword.html). The Rust Book
differs in its approach most notably by its focus on the application of Rust
and the surrounding ecosystems (crates, program structure, etc.). The process of
dissecting this book is the second of four phases I've lined out for a month of
learning this language throughly.

My thought process as of now is that these phases look like this...
```
1.) Learning the language design and nuance of new concepts (borrowing, lifetimes, etc.)
2.) Apply concepts in guided application and continued study
3.) Apply concepts in tradition computer science terms (algorithms and data structures)
4.) Build something
```
