### Learning Rust
#### And Other Curiosities About the World

This collection of programs and ramblings is meant to be a central place for
applying concepts for learning Rust, or rather, for relearning what I once
knew and better applying myself to the processes.

The directory `./rbe-examples` is a collection of each of the corresponding
example applications built from the wonderful book, Rust By Example which I
highly recommend and which you can find [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example).
