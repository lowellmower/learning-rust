### Custom Types

### Concepts
- Defining and characterizing a structure (`struct`)
- Defining an enumeration (`enum`)
- Constants / statics (`const`, `static`)

### Notes
Three notable types of structs, named tuples (meh), unit structs which are
useful for generics, and the classic C style struct.

A useful macro was introduced to keep warnings quite from the compiler with
respect to unused code `#![allow(dead_code)]` or apply it as the debug macro
is on a single object.
