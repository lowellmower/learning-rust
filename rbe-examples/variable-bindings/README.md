### Variable Bindings

### Concepts
- Explicit typing versus inference
- Mutability of variables
- Scoping and shadowing

### Notes
Nothing ground breaking here. I disagree with how easily the language allows
you to shadow, however, the bumpers of the compiler seem to be the mechanism
by which this is checked so the risk is limited if one doesn't go around
fighting the compiler.
